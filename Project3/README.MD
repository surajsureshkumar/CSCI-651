The zip file is named Project3 and contains the report for the project, the program file and the readme file.

I wrote the program in nano editor so if you are doing the same I don't think that you will be able to copy the code
and paste it there.

I installed a virtual box and added the VM image to the virtual box.
I am running this on windows machine through the help of a virtual box(don't know about MAC).
Used the nano editor which is available in the mininet vm to code the python script.
I wrote the program in nano editor using python and ran it using the root access.
I have done a mix of the program and mininet vm terminal. So you might not get the exact output if you just run the
program

In my report I have added the image of the code that I wrote in nano editor in the mininet vm using python.
The report contains the detailed execution of steps and the results of the steps.
The code file might be a mere reference to you.

Suppose if the code file does not run on your machine then I would gladly sit with you on a call and give a demo of how
it is running on my machine and show you the outputs.
